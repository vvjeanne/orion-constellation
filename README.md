A graphical visualization of the Orion constellation and its major stars.<br>
I have created a graphical visualization of the Orion constellation using Pythonâ€™s turtle graphics module, plotting star positions with coordinate-based drawing. Labeled major stars, rendered constellation lines, and demonstrated foundational skills in coordinate geometry, graphical programming, and event-free rendering.
